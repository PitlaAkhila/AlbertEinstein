            <h2><b>ABOUT</b></h2>
            <p>
                Albert Einstein was born on March 14, 1879, into a secular Ashkenazi Jewish family in Ulm, 
                Kingdom of WÃ¼rttemberg, German Empire. His parents were Pauline Koch and Hermann Einstein, 
                an engineer and merchant. The family relocated to Munich around 1880.
                The Elektrotechnische Fabrik J. Einstein & Cie, a business that produced 
                direct current electrical equipment, was founded by Einstein's father and his uncle Jakob.
                From a young age, Einstein was a math and physics prodigy, rising to a level of proficiency 
                years ahead of his contemporaries.
                During the course of one summer, 12-year-old Einstein taught himself algebra and Euclidean geometry.
            </p>
            <p>
                He was hired as a lecturer at the University of Bern in 1908 after gaining notoriety 
                as a distinguished scientist.As he delivered a lecture on electrodynamics and 
                the relativity principle at the University of Zurich the next year, Alfred Kleiner suggested 
                he be considered for a newly created professorship in theoretical physics by the faculty. 
                In 1909, Einstein was made an associate professor.

            Sailing, reading, and playing the violin and piano were among Albert Einstein's pastimes. 
            Also, he kept travel diaries, which are currently housed in the Jerusalem-based Albert Einstein Archives.

        </p>

        <p>
            Over his life, Einstein owned multiple sailboats. He kept one in Caputh, Germany, which the 
            Nazis confiscated along with his cottage in 1933. He once owned a yacht by the name of Tinnef while 
            residing in the United States.
